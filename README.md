# BioAI: Advanced Statistical Methods for Biological Data Science

The **BioAI** toolkit is a comprehensive computational framework designed to integrate advanced statistical methodologies with cutting-edge bioinformatics applications. It offers versatile solutions for experimental design, patient stratification, and clinical data analysis, enabling researchers to derive meaningful insights from complex biological datasets.

## Core Components

### 1. Stable Hash Partitioning for Experimental Design
The toolkit incorporates a robust hash-based sample allocation mechanism to ensure deterministic and reproducible group assignment, enhancing experimental integrity and reproducibility.

```python
def hash_assign(identifier, groups=["control", "treatment"], seed=42):
    """Deterministic group assignment with MurmurHash3"""
    hash_value = mmh3.hash(str(identifier), seed)
    return groups[hash_value % len(groups)]
```
**Applications:** This method is particularly suited for:
- Randomizing subjects in clinical trials
- Conducting A/B testing for treatment protocols
- Ensuring reproducible experiment designs in bioinformatics

### 2. Statistical Inference Framework
BioAI provides a rigorous framework for conducting statistically robust experimental analyses with biological relevance:
- Calculation of Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) for precise power estimation
- Confidence interval-based effect size estimation
- Distinguishing between biological and statistical significance to improve result interpretation

### 3. Patient Stratification
Advanced RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and clustering algorithms are incorporated to facilitate:
- Identification of high-value patient cohorts
- Prediction of treatment adherence patterns
- Optimization of resource allocation in clinical environments

### Implementation Example
```python
from bioai.experiment import BioExperiment
from bioai.distribution import hash_assignment

# 1. Design experiment
experiment = BioExperiment(
    baseline_rate=0.15,
    sample_size=200,
    alpha=0.05
)

# 2. Calculate required parameters
mde = experiment.calculate_mde()
print(f"Minimum Detectable Effect: {mde:.4f}")

# 3. Assign subjects to groups
patient_ids = ["PTID001", "PTID002", "PTID003"]
assignments = {pid: hash_assignment(pid) for pid in patient_ids}

# 4. Analyze results
results = experiment.analyze(control_data, treatment_data)
```

### Case Study: Medicaid Contract Compliance Analysis
BioAI has been successfully deployed in healthcare insurance compliance systems. Key achievements include:
- Application of NLP algorithms to extract insights from Medicaid regulatory documents
- Development of inference models to detect compliance discrepancies in contract data
- Creation of a GenAI application to automate compliance assessments and deliver actionable recommendations

**Results:** The system identified 83% of compliance issues with 91% precision, achieving a 67% reduction in manual review time.

## Technical Stack
- **Core:** Python, NumPy, SciPy
- **Statistical Analysis:** statsmodels, scikit-learn
- **Data Processing:** pandas, mmh3
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
