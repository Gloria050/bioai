# BioAI: Biological Experiment Design Module

The **Biological Experiment Design Module** is an integral component of the BioAI toolkit, offering specialized tools for constructing reliable, unbiased experimental designs in biomedical research. This module emphasizes precision in sample allocation, data handling, and reproducibility.

## Core Components

### 1. Stable Hash Partitioning for Experimental Design (`hash_experiment.py`)
This tool employs cryptographic hashing techniques to enable deterministic sample assignment. By utilizing sample IDs or unique identifiers, this method ensures:

- Deterministic allocation for consistent reproducibility
- Elimination of researcher bias or manipulation in group assignment
- Balanced distribution of sample characteristics across groups

**Applications:**
- Randomization of subjects in clinical trials
- Sample assignment in drug sensitivity studies
- Multi-group control experiment designs

### 2. Biological Data Processing (`bio_data_processing.ipynb`)
This Jupyter Notebook presents a structured workflow for comprehensive biomedical data analysis, including:

- Data importation and initial exploration
- Handling of missing values and anomaly detection
- Standardization and normalization procedures
- Feature engineering and selection techniques
- Dimensionality reduction strategies
- Visualization and interpretation of results

The workflow addresses the unique challenges of biomedical data, including high dimensionality, noise, and limited sample sizes, ensuring robust outcomes.

## Implementation Example

### Hash-Based Experimental Design
```python
from bio_experiments.hash_experiment import HashExperimentDesigner

# Initialize experiment designer with group count and seed value
designer = HashExperimentDesigner(n_groups=3, seed=42)

# Generate sample ID list
sample_ids = [f"SAMPLE_{i}" for i in range(100)]

# Assign samples to groups
assignments = designer.assign_samples(sample_ids)

# Display sample counts for each group
for group, samples in assignments.items():
    print(f"Group {group}: {len(samples)} samples")

# Validate distribution balance
designer.validate_balance(assignments)
```

### Biological Data Processing
